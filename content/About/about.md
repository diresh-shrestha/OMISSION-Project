title: Behind The Name
paragraph: >-
  Omission Project arose from an awareness of shrinking newsrooms across the
  United States. We believe that as local coverage continues to diminish, it
  becomes more likely for people to not see their own reality reflected in
  national narratives. This challenges public trust in journalists to provide
  fair and accurate information. In this context, “Omission” refers to two
  elements:


  1. The omission of local community voices in news coverage. 

  2.  The omission of details by journalists, and public trust in their ability to maintain integrity.
     
  Our mission is to organize a broader community to engage with journalism through the medium of clothing. We aim to put garments in conversation with media ecology; bringing awareness to media literacy and the contemporary conditions of the digital landscape. 50% of our profits are donated to Report for America with the intention of supporting the growth of emerging journalists and local journalism.


  We’d be honored for you to share our message in pursuit of a more well-informed public.
