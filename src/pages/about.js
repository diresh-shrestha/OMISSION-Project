      <p>
        Our mission is to organize a community to engage with journalism and
        celebrate the work of individuals in the field. Through the medium of
        clothing, we aim to put garments in conversation with media ecology;
        bringing awareness to media literacy and the contemporary conditions of
        the digital landscape.
